If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothing handed
Took nothing for granted
Took nothing from no man
Man I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man
Man you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna'
Say next summer I'm finna'
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is little Tre's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job

The second verse is for my dawgs working 9 to 5
That still hustle 'cause a nigga can't shine off 6 55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move south
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job, so since he couldn't get work
He figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
A nigga's money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep baking 'till the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say
My niggas

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of them dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song +12 questions+
We scream, rock, blows, weed, park
See now we smart
We ain't retards, the way teachers starve
Hold up, hold fast. We make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Bad enough we on welfare
They trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm trying to get the car with the chromie wheels here
They trying to cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us
Fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say
My niggas

Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus [a Lexus]
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop

I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it

Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers
That's a +Different World+ like +Cree Summers+
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maebach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waiting on my spaceship, blaow

You know what the Midwest is?  Young and Restless
Where restless Niggaz might snatch your necklace
And next these Niggaz might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these Niggaz who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless!
Try to catch it! It's kinda hard hard
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying "we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Yall eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us
Well momma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone til November I got packs to move I Hope

To the hustlas, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cuz we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way yall need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feeling it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealing it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggaz praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now romeo must die?
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

now, my flow
Is in the pocket like Wallace, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this
Bastards flow will bash a skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I don't, usualy smoke but pass the dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we ass holes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
Cuz we don't wanna here that weak shit no mo'

now who the hell is this
Emailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36 26, plus double d
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubblee
At NYU but she headed from Kansas
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with a feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W H I T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli, You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib
I mean that's my favorite CD that I play at my crib
I mean you don't really know him, why is you lyin
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She gon' think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista set get it wet
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still killa a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone 
so you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big firl if you ain't fit girl I'll hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends OK 3 more now hop in the Benz
Four door do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas

I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing me, calling me +Biggie+ like +Shyne+ home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dawg said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma lay this Vandross, you gon take yo pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali?
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say something significant
But now I'm rapping 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm trying to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like 'oh well, the shoes and the toothpick'
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for three ninety nine
Later on I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a mug
She asked "Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?"
While we drive she telling me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he tricking off, don't get no rich nigga
Give ME some head, that'll really piss hI'm off

I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sending me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

I'ma get on this TV, momma
I'ma, I'ma break shit down
I'ma make sure these light skinned niggaz
Never ever never come back in style
Told them I finished school, and I started my own business
They say, 'Oh you graduated?'
No, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This nigga graduated at the top of my class..
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there

I got a Jones like Norah for your sorror'
Bring more of them girls I've seen in the Aurora
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or'a Shirley
I'm trying to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry
See, that's how dude became the young pootie tang tippy tow
Rocafella chain, yeah that's my rapper style
Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style
Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style
And I ain't even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man beserk
Not to worry Mr. H to the Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that +Dynasty+ sign
No use in me trying to be lying, I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire HA! I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to +Make a Band+
I swear this right here, history in the making man

What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, Wrong time
in the blink of a eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe, safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I looked like Tom Cruise on +Vanilla Sky+, it was televised
All they heard was in accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
"Unbreakable", what you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, +This Can't Be Life+
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Pumpkin bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did God have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Hey B, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Now, we getting it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get them shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talking 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the rising sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sitting here, grilling people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second he storm out then she storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business

The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac
The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop saving all the good beats for himself
Rocafella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bourgie, he big headed
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Tes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli, I put him on songs with Jay Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye, 
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shopping my demo, I was trying to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
'Oh my god, is that a black card?'
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term
African American Express
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killing y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

And I heard them say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a Hardaway
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the governments administer aids
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours 
But these niggaz from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars with seeing cop cars 
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it

They say people in life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gram' keep praying and keep believing
in Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down 
So now my little cousin smoking them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than liquorish now
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed, I felt like Bad Boy's street team
I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take them back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apartament
... Let's take them back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jaboc an hour
after I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line, dawg in due time
Now he look at me like damn dawg, you what I am
A hip hop legend, I think I died
in an accident, cause this must be heaven

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man these niggaz that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Culdn't keep it home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

Cutie the bomb
Met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton
Under her underarm
She said I can tell you ROC
I can tell by ya charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by ya charm and ya arm
but I'm looking for the one
have you seen her
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
An I gotta take all they bad ass to showbiz
Ok get ya kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be payed
You know why
It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of y'all say I still love her

18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was spose to buy ya shorty TYCO with ya money
She went to the doctor got lypo with ya money
She walking around looking like Micheal with ya money
Should of got that insured got GEICO for ya money
If you ain't no punk holla We Want Prenup
WE WANT PRENUP!, Yeah
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave yo ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his

Now I ain't saying you a gold digger you got needs
You dont want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he cant pay y'all cant leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datson
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's balling but yea that's nice
And they gone keep calling and trying
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo ass for a white girl

My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked the 'Leases, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil something, 16 he was stuntin
"Al B. Sure!" nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lakeshore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lakers and Aurora's, we was hurting them all
With the girls alot of flirting involved, dog..
Fuck all that flirting, I'm trying to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me, "Don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie"

How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?  What Gil Scott is "Heron"
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack, raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We, invested in that, it's like we got Merrill Lynched
And we been hanging from the same tree, ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends, cop it, nowadays they can't tell if
that's that good shit, we ain't sure man
Put the CD on your tongue, yeah that's pure man

From the place where the father's gone, the mothers is hardly home
And the madigon's lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say, we just trying to party homes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical
Arm and Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove cause
Cause, dreams of being Hova
Went from being a broke man to being a dopeman
to being the President, look there's hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
... And this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you 'round that

that's that crack music, crack music
That real black music, black music
Our father, give us this day, our daily bread
Before the feds give us these days and take our daily bread
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
And to atone, I throw a lil' something something on the pulpit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back, was crack, music
And now we ooze it, through they nooks and crannies
So our mommas ain't got to be they, cooks and nannies
And we gon' repo everything they ever took from grammy
Now the former slaves trade hooks, for Grammy's
This dark diction, has become America's addiction
Those who ain't even black use it
We gon' keep bagging up this here, crack music

I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anaesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin
Hey chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time?  Remember when I was 9?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin
Her family crying, they want her to live, and she tryin
I'm arguing like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke muh'fuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now she'd be okay?  But since she
was just a secretary, worked for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here
My grandfather trying to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse did you do the research?
She asked me can you sign some tshirts?
Bitch, is you smoking reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?  But still

They outside of the emergency room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now she sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "One Thing"
When they said that she made you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
Cause with my family we know we're home
And so instead of sending flowers, we the roses

We gon' last today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you evern wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggaz marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life before they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely living, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, before I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say "No habla ingles"
And everybody want to run to me for their SINGLE
It's funny how these wack niggaz need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin

What's your addiction?  Is it money?  Is it girls?  Is it weed?
I've been afflicted, by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
And she's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peak now, I mean dang, I'm so, curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need you, to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca Cola
Then I'm coming over, cause it's never over

I see the emotion, in your eyes, that you tried, not to show
We get the closest, when you high, or you drunk, or you blowed
So I pour the potion, so we can both, get high, as we can go
Then I'll get the lotion, it do something to me, when your thighs, is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I, don't mean, to impose
Not now but right now, I need you, to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and Coca Cola
And I keep coming over, cause it's never over, u

Good morning, this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, fo' real
Little was known on Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I spit the diamonds in this song
I ain't talking 'bout the ones that be glowin'
I'm talking 'bout Roc a Fella, my home
My chain, this ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin', "Keep shinin'"
How? When I know what a blood diamond 's
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
On a Polo rugby it look so nice
How can something so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? before I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc a Fella diamond tonight

Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggaz hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'ma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
Good music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree?  Don't you agree?
and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me why you call it "Late Registration" 'Ye?
Cause we taking these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

I want to tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm feeling let it shine
I'm feeling take y'all back to them better times
I'm feeling talk about my momma if y'all don't mind
I was 3 years old when you and I move to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fix me up something that was good for my soul
Famous home chicken soup, can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and the glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me, and I love you for that mommy can't you see
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheat and telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'm a love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't got to work no more
And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do, send us an angel
And I thank you

Forest Gump momma said, life was like a box of chocolates
My momma told me go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you can profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like there's things I gotta get, things I gotta do
Just to prove to you, you was getting through
Can the choir please, gimme a verse of you, eyes so beautiful, to me
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry, Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see you dance with thee
Now when I say hey, y'all say mama
Now everybody answer me

Tell your job you gotta fake them out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'm a get you a Jag whateva else you want
Just tell me what kind of S Type Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday, for me to just call and say

Why you acting all, shy and all
Why is y'all lying fo'?
"I never did this before..." stop that
What you want, some Patron? I got that
I mean, I promise y'all, you fine and all
And yo girlfriend, she kinda raw
But she not like you, no she not like you
Right now, I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talking is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of y'all
Right now the Louis Vuitton Don is signing off

See you know my style, I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy, and tell him that yo mama had a fatty
He looked up at me said, "Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?"
Yup! We was practicing, 'til one day
Yo ass bust thought the packagin
You know what though, you my favorite accident
So go 'head, pop some Cristal for my newborn child
Cause now, "y'all"..

You sweat her, and I ain't talking 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talking 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
BROTHER NUMPSAY!  Groupies sound too choosy
Take them to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to "Let it Burn"
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguing over babysitters like, "Bitch it's yo' turn!"
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
Roc pastel with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top where dude belong
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through East St. Laurent glasses
And I realise that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my vibe, does
He write his own rhymes, sort of, I think them
That mean I forgat better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up
I ask, if you talk about classics do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop top Porsche
It's spoiling yourself thats important
If you stripper name Porcha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is minivan
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only player that got robbed and kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried talk some sense in him
Thrity minutes later saw his note convincing him
What mo' could you ask fo'
The international asshole
Who complained about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though
Somebody still speak from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is ya'll to pronounce my name
Is Kanye but some of my plaques still say Kayne
Got family in the D King, folks from Motown
Back in Chi, them folks ain't from Motown
Life moving too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, she need to go down
My father Ben said I need Jesus, so he took me to church
And let the water let the water run over my sleezer
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got steel, like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message to leave it
The Roc stand tall, and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw them up like you bulimic
Ya, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust gets swept off
Big K kick it where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I drop my new shit, it sound like the best of
A and Rs looking like we messed up
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, we really though, ya he next up
People asking me is I gon'give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question all yo, where Dame at?
He's tracked the Indian dance to bring our rain back
What's up with you and Jay, man? Are ya'll okay, man?
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
right here stand a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister by hisself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test
You got D's, m'uhfucker D's~! Rosie Perez
And yeah that's barely passed, an E in every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homey this shit is basic, welcome to graduation

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from a eighth to a ki'
But you graduate when you make it up out of the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

Good morning and, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stoled yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't saying we was from the projects
But everytime I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad would say, when you see clothes close your eyelids
We was sorta like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talking 'bout the rich ones
Cause every summer, he'd get some
brand new hairbrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe

When it feel like living's harder than dyin
For me, giving up's way harder than tryin
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin
Cause who the kids gon' listen to
HA~?! I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pledge, at least for the principal
They got the CD then got to see me
Drop gems, like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they now they invincible

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian and and Christian Dior
Damn they don't make them like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure, do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go Ape shit
Specially on my pastel on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homey take six, and take this haters

Me likey
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
God put me in the plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me
There's a thousand yous there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
'Casue is Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a klondike
well I'd do anything for a blonde dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And will do anything when the time's right
UH, baby you're making it harder, better, faster, stronger

You say he get on yo' FUCKing nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves... word?
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryn' find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is 
It ain't happen yet and that's where the tuition is
Will you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms?
The smoke screens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean?

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic where my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name will help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm...
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why He keep giving me hotlines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Something in ya blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?

Welcome to the good life, where niggaz will sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look sorry!
Yo it's gots to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

Welcome to the good life! Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got mo' ASS THAN THE MODELS
The good life, so keep it coming with the bottles
Cause she feel booze/boos like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ayyyyy~! This is the good life
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I WISH A NIGGA WOULD
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let them hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while getting some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen +Snakes on a Plane+"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Having money's not everything not having it is
I was splurging on Tryst, but when I get my card back
activated, I'm back to Vegas
Cause I always had a passion for flashin
Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined
The good life

I had a dream I can buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To what much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, got some chilli, get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewlery, more Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I aint going Hill man
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forget where I came from

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homey, you decide yours 
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parrallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day 
But homey this is my day, class started 2 hours ago
Oh am I late? 
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it 
They say I talk with so much emphasis
they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like colligen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem man, aight man, holla then

Let the champaigne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get pass
You don't needa stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off the fumes cause
How you move in a room full of nose?
How you stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold 
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, HUH, depending how you dress her 
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
But way less effort, cause when you try hard
that's when you die hard 
Ya homies looking like +Why God?+
When they reminisce over you my God

It's what ya all been waiting fo', ain't it?
What people pay paper fo', damnit
They can't stand it, they want something new
So let's get reacquainted, became the hood favorite
I can't even explaing it, I surprise myself too
Life of a don, lights keep glowin
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm, uh uh uh
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

Fresh off the plane, konichiwa bitches
Turn around another plane my passport on pimpin
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it, then he shit it
I don't need writers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I been a very good sport, haven't I this year?
They say "He going crazy, and we seen this before"
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink Polo
Nigga please, how you gon' say I ain't no low head
Cause my Dior got me mo' my dough head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard 'til your knees hit your fo'head
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MC's, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MC's, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a don, lights keep glowin
Coming in the club with that fresh shit on
With something crazy on my arm, uh uh uh
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

She don't believe in shooting stars 
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment 
Couture from the store's departments
You more like love to start shit  
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres views of the water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy, man why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy?
And try to hit you with the ol' whopty
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
A bay, lately, you been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no F.E.M.A.
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just saying, hey Mona Lisa come home
You know you can't +Rome+ without +Caesar+

I'll never be picture perfect Beyonce
Be light as Al B., or black as Chauncey
Remember him from BLACKstreet, He was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the winter like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summer time like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear them gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay fair enough, the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
They'd rather give me the nigga please award
But I'll just take the I got alotta cheese award 

I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man, killin's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rapping
Do you know what it feel like when people is passing
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

Can I talk my shit again?... 
Even if I don't hit again?
Dog are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat Louis Vuitton stitch
With Donatello Versace, that's Louis Vuitton bitch
I think...Hennesey I drink I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona I'm zonin'
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwayne Wade
And ay please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers... I'm the hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rock a chain instead a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romanced
Cameras flash so much that I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on award tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy the hood love to listen Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy... I did it for the glory

What I'm supposed to do now man 
the game all messed up
How I'm supposed to stand out 
when everybody get dressed up
So yea at the Grammy's I went ultra Travolta
Yea that tuxedo mighta been a little guido 
But with my ego I can stand here in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind the empty bottles of no doze
Tank on empty whipping my mama Volvo
Spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard think I'm Hugo's Boss
Why I gotta ask what that 2 door cost
House on the hills two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking bout her girlfriends yea the dark skinnded one
She asking bout the speedboats I admit we rented them
When you meet me in person what do ya feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
Ya know BIG and Pac ya know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L or Notorious
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'ma stop killing these niggas 
soon as the chorus hit

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil' homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and, I like blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggaz come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to to' them off
And make them straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn'ta never hit the airport, to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said you left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggaz trying to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all, wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's, gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back, home
And guess when I heard, when I was back, home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters wave them around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi Town

Fresh off the plane, Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that "Blueprint" one
And these beats in my pocket was that "Blueprint" for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'll bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by the "Black Album" I was blacking out
Partying S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Colleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito
Hola, Hovito
The game getting foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steephole
And we know, "New Jack City" got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came thru and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammy's I said "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick and roll
Cuz even if he gave me the rock, it's give and go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gon' mingle, yo
Heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like "Damn, no way"
Translate, espanol "No way, Jose"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known THAT was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell them
People never get the flowers while they can still smell them
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the city, Rocafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
on one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say "Motherfucker your momma's a bitch."
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man
Big pimping like Jigga man,
oh I guess I figure it's

And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me,
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking and
This relationship it even got me back to drinkin'
Now this Hennessey
It's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny,
but I can't even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that I'd try you would question me
Saying, "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them ho's will be."
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
Bittersweet, I fucked up and I know it G
You're gonna be the death of me, I guess it's bittersweet poetry
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you, hate you at the very same time

My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car

G'head crack a joke all the kids laugh
But I couldn't hear them all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

My god sister getting married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to Heartbreak

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me though
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know its some things that you ain't told me
Ayo I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna give me back and you gonna show me
So you walk round like you don't know me
You got a new friend
Well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

How could you be so Dr. Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
Cuz I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that ya leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Talking talking talking thaw
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know bout me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gonna keep hating me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gonna take off tonight
Into the night

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
and that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming, "No, no, no, no..."
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from HOME, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you before it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just wasting time, where's the finish line?

Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do you good, might do us good
Before we be done for good
Cause I make it good I could make it hood
I can make you come I can make you go
I can make you high I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so
All of the time
You be up in mine checking through my cell phone baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight oh here we go
Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see them look
Baby let them look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed
Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

Bout the baddest girl I ever seen 
Straight up out a movie scene 
Who knew she was a drama queen 
That a turn my life to Stephen King 
Up late night like she on patrol 
Checking everything like I'm on parole 
I told her some things she don't need to know 
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok 
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now 
Ok, Ok, Ok 
You will never stop it now 
You need to drop it now.... drop it... drop it

Just looking at your history 
You like the girl from Misery 
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree 
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on 
Keep it up enough to keep it goin? on 
I told her some things she don't need to know 
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok 
You will never stop it now 
You never stop it now 
Ok, ok, ok, ok 
You will never stop it now 
You need to drop it now.... drop it... drop it

Stop...drop...roll...pop bitch I'm cold....I 
Ain't used to being told stop 
So I could never be your robot 
Fast or slow you can stay or can go 
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know 
Yea I had her before but that happened before 
You get mad when you know so just don't ask me no more 
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh 
It ain't ok, ok, ok

Let me know
Do I still got time to grow
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me
Seems like, street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there
All the streets, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there
In the streets
In the, streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
Seems like, street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowin
Happen to be just like moments, passin
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there
In the streets
In the, streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
Life's just not fair

Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules
Cause I just heard some real bad news
People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you how long have you known dude
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide, to break the rules
Cause I just heard some real bad news

Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
It's so crazy, crazy crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I sacrifice, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
Do you think I sacrifice, a real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
To get my heart, out of this hell
And my mind, out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
They always say "Kanye, he keeps it real boy"
Pinocchio's story is, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
It's funny
Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm looking for something out there, trying to find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some put side on TV that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, to say sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cry, and say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes
And there is no Gepetto, to guide me
No one, right beside me
The only one, was behind me
I can't find her no more, I can't follow no more
I can't...
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasing the American dream
Chasing everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left, and the clothes was left
And the hoes was left, you talk the hoes to death
Peeping the money to death, you spend the dough to death
And tell me what be left, for a real boy!
They say "Kanye, you keep it too real boy"
Perspective, and wise man say
One day, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
Wise man say

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, Mercy Me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs' need to listen to the models
You ain't got no FUCKing Yeezy in yo' Serato?
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
+Sex is on Fire+, I'm the +King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
+Hey Teacher+ teacher, tell me how do you respawn the students
and refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance, we've killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels' on your team, that's why your wins' low/you're Winslow
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull out the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
and eventually answers to the call of Autumn
all of them falling for the love of ballin'
get caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
intercentury anthems based off inner city tantrums
based off the way we was branded
face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
and at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
but we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
this the real world, homie, school finished
they done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Is hip hop, just a euphemism for a new religion
the soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
as long as I'm in Polo's smiling they think they got me
but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
if a nigga aint shooting a jumpshot, running a track meet
but this pimp is, ar the top of mount Olympus
ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
we make them say ho cause the game is so pimpish
choke a south park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
and these drugs, niggas cant resist it
remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
if I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

I need more drinks and less lights
and that American Apparel girl in just tights
she told the director she tryna get into school
he said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”
it's been a while since I watched the tube
cause like a crip set, I got way too many blues for anymore bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
they rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
and what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
but God said I need a different approach
cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
it's not funny anymore try different jokes
tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
act like I aint had a belt and two classics
I aint got it I'm going after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
you blowing up, that's good, fantastic
that y'all, its like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
cause the same people that tried to blackball me
forgot about 2 things, my black balls

I'm living in that 21st century
Doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you've ever seen do it
Scream from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero needs his theme music

The system broken, the school closed, the prison opened
We ain't got nothing to lose, Ma'fucka we rolling
Huh? Ma'fucka we rolling
There's some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white mans' world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world, I see you in the morning
Huh? I see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole, you niggas got jokes
You short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My is furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty 
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
But these responsibilities that they entrust in me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking

Hova, Powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation
At the end of the day, Goddamnit I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't got to power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doin? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hiding?
I got the power make your life so exciting

Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone, a nigga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take them to that ghetto university

Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts suck me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
It's nada who you go and get, ain't nobody as cold as this
Do the rap, and the track, tripled up and no assist
And my only focus is, staying on some bogus shit
Argue with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard the preacher saying raps are getting trap, mayne
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but he’s holding up my accent
She came up to me and said, "This the number 2 gal"
If you wanna make it number one, you're number two now
This that Goose and Malibu I call it Maliboo yah

Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool down
'Cause you will never get on top off this
So mami, best advice is to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharoah?
I put the pussy in a sarcophagus!
Now she claiming I bruise her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallow ship
I'm living in the future, so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass!

I'm so appalled, Spalding balled
Balled in and Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don’t mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn 
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweepin
That know we get O’s like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos

Praises due to the Most High Allah
Praises due to the most fly Prada
Baby I'm magic tah dah!
Address me as your highness. high as United 
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas going through real shit, man they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That’s why I rather spit something that got a purp

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I've seen good Christians
Make brash decisions Oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message breakups, the casualty of tour
How she gonna wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you're stunting on a JumboTron
I'm looking at her like, this what you really wanted, huh?
Why we arguing anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour
And out of all the colors that fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, our whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase and he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, took a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said, “You are what you eat”
You see, I always loved the sense of humor
But tonight, you should've seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior homme
That's Dior homme, not Dior, homie
The crib's Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you me more phony?
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

I think I just fell in love with a pornstar
Turn the camera on she's a born star
Turn the corners in the foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga an ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ??, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun come, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown cop a suite space, uh
Living life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes, huh?
Well I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

Never in your wildest dreams, 
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams 
Coming from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
She said her price'll go down if she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or a gangbang, 
it's kinda crazy it's all considered the same thang
Well I guess alotta niggaz do gangbang
and if we run trains we're all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

One day I'm gon' marry a pornstar
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothing to hide we both screwed the bridesmaid
She wanna roleplay, till I roll over
I'mma need a whole day, at least roll doja
We'll party as we go into an oscar day
Especially if she can't get that dress from Oscar De La Renta
They wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her get away
How can you say they live their life wrong, 
When you never fuck with the lights on

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface..
Been a long time since I spoke to you 
in a bathroom gripping you up, fucking and choking you
...What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
..And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a, mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggaz is stroking you
Might say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like, "What was I supposed to do?"
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrest'ers
I heard he bought some coke with my money dat ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed, for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl"
You'll probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame? You to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame...

Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with WHO? That's old news
I'm in a speed boat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu, with no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you!"
Immature adult insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your asphalt/ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last thought
Get what you ask for, I swear that's your ass so
She got a big, booty but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take your last hoe and rope up all the cash flow
When you getting money they be all up on your ass yo
When you getting money Kan's don't let a nigga pass go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell him I said "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said "HELL NO!"
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got her man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit, my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre, looking for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Roley's and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferrari's
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Bonnie's
End up at Marley, Georgio, service from Sergio
The keen Lamborghini, chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellafied vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, 32
Lyrically can't none of y'all murder 'Ye
Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got styled last June and she heard of me/ May
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the diving board when I am bored
All my homies G.D.'s, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's something that you could use in analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality

Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearin
Fuck what, FUCK whatever y'all been wearin
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's
Take my number and lock it in
Indian head, no Moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Tims all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggaz off than Cochran, huh!
On sight... on sight!...

Baby girl try and get a nut
And her girl try and give it up
Chopped them both down
Don't +judge+ them, Joe Brown
One last announcment
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin
Err'body wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth, hah!
On sight... on sight!...

For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My "by any means" on
Pardon, I'm getting my screams on

Soon as they like you, make them unlike you
cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The ONLY rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hating ass niggaz to fight you
And here's a few snake ass niggaz to bite you
I don't even wanna hear about, what niggaz might do
Old niggaz mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans, they ain't NEVER like you
Pink ass Polos with a FUCKing backpack
But err'body know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man WE the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn Diamond, Chi Town shining
Monop' in this bitch again, change the climate
Hop in this bitch again, same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning...

My momma was raised in the era when
clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes, you woulda thought I help

Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratched your Corolla
Okay I smashed your Corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I could own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call Tupac over

And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fucking, biting ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let them out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leaving fast
Had to stop at 7 Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lying, I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasing love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eating Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce!
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racing since the summertime

Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you're sitting courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep them separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night yo' heart died
Then you gotta go and tell yo' girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now yo' driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owe that money that the court got
All in on that alimony

Yeah, 'til death but do your part
unholy matrimony

Maybe it's cause, she into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio couldn't have helped
It's getting cold, better bring your ski clothes
Pick it through the keyhole the door locked by myself
... And I'm feeling it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka blocka, blocka
Pour a little, champagne, cranberry, vodka
Feeling lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a, +Shaka+
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new, Shabba!
She looking for her daddy, call me Big, Poppa

She said, "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I said, "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I, go raw, I like to leave it in
When I, wake up, I like to go again
When I, go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't, go to work, same clothes again
And her, heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again

What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She said she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty

Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want
I want to wake up with you in my eyes

I go, I go, ay ay, I go
Up in the morning, miss you bad
Sorry I ain't called you back

All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good

Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
